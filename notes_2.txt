Importing
In Python, each .py file is a module, and we can import functions, variables, and classes from one module into another with the import statement. 
The name of a module is the filename (without the .py extension).

Game Loop
Video games are generally built using a game loop. The simplest game loop has 3 steps:

1. Check for player inputs
2. Update the game world
3. Draw the game to the screen

To create a good user experience, these 3 steps need to happen many times per second.
