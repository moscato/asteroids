Create a virtual environment at the top level of your project directory:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
$ source venv/bin/activate

You should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt, for example, mine is:

$ (venv) wagslane@MacBook-Pro-2 Asteroids %



$ apt install python3.12-venv ... for ubuntu btw


Activate the virtual environment:
$ source venv/bin/activate

You should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt, for example, mine is:

$ (venv) v@v-Lenovo-ThinkBook-15-IIL:~/Desktop/bootDev/oop/asteroids$

Make sure that your virtual environment is activated when running the game or using the bootdev CLI.

Create a file called requirements.txt in the top level of your project directory with the following contents:
pygame==2.6.1

This tells Python that this project requires pygame version 2.6.1.

Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip is Python's package manager. It will install the pygame module into the virtual environment you created.

Make sure pygame is installed:
python3 -m pygame

This will result in an error (the test expects an exit code of 1), but the output will show that pygame is installed.

REMEMBER:
Starting venv goes:
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
ending venv just goes:
  deactivate

You wanna look for (venv) at the start of your prompt.

Quick reminder*
git add .
git commit -m "whatever"
git push -u origin main
